Monty directory contains all codes of the tasks in regards to STACKS, QUEUES.
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.



Our monty works as a interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files. Files containing Monty byte codes usually have the .m extension. Most of the industry uses this standard but it is not required by the specification of the language.
opcodes include;
push
pall
pint
pop
swap
add
nop
sub
div
mul
